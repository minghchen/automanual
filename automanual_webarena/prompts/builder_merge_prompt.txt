You are observing a web page agent as it codes and acts within a Web environment. Your goal is to construct a manual of rules to assist the agent in completing tasks. Your role is to merge or delete previously found rules by analyzing the experiences of the agent.

[user]
You will be presented with the current found rules. The rules are extracted from many epochs' trajectories, in which each interaction includes the agent's analysis, execution code, and the resulting feedback.

A rule is represented with 'rule_id' and has the following attributes:
   - rule: the description of the rule, which begins with its use case or scope.
   - type: the type of the rule, chosen from ["Special Phenomena/Mechanism", "Corrected Error", "Unresolved Error", "Success Process"].
   - example: an example (or code) from the trajectory demonstrates this rule. You can add detailed information in the comment.
   - validation_record: your validation record on this rule, including the epoch IDs and rule IDs from which this rule is induced.

You should use the following methods of rule_manager to delete and merge rules.

rule_manager.update_rule(rule_id, rule="", type="", example="", validation_record=""),
# Rewrite the attributes of an existing rule when you come up with a better understanding. 
# Input only the attributes you want to rewrite.

rule_manager.delete_rule(rule_id),
# delete a existing rule with rule_id.
# **How to merge** To merge two existing rules, you can call rule_manager.update_rule for one rule and then call rule_manager.delete_rule to delete another rule.

rule_manager.get_interactions(epoch_ids)
# Get the interaction history of previous epochs by their IDs.
# Use Case: You can use this tool to get the interactions from previous epochs (epoch starts from 0). You may need to check the validation_record of an existing rule to know which epochs to get.
# Parameters: 
#   epoch_ids: a string containing the epoch IDs from previous epochs, separated by commas, e.g., epoch_0,epoch2.

rule_manager.stop_generating()
# Description: stop generating rules from the current epoch.
# Use Case: You should call this function when you have finished updating all rules for the current epoch.

At each epoch, an agent is created in an environment, and the target task and observation are printed. The observations including:
- The open tabs: These are the opened tabs .
- The web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.
- The web page's URL: This is the URL of the current page.

The agent can only use the following action functions:
### Page Operation Actions:
agent.click(id, option="") # clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage
agent.type(id, content, clear_existing=True, press_enter_after=True) # type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to False
agent.hover(id) # hover over an element with id
agent.press(key_comb) # simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v)
agent.scroll(direction) # scroll the page up or down
### Tab Management Actions:
agent.new_tab() # open a new, empty browser tab
agent.tab_focus(tab_index) # switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index
agent.close_tab() # close the currently active tab
### URL Navigation Actions:
agent.goto(url) # navigate to a specific URL
agent.go_back() # navigate to the previously viewed page
agent.go_forward() # navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed)
### Completion Action:
agent.stop(answer="") # issue this action when the task is believed to be completed and provide the answer in the bracket.

[Detailed instructions]
**Maintain a maximum of 15 rules**
**Merge if addressed** If a "Success Process" rule can address the "Corrected Error" or "Unresolved Error" rule, you can consider merging these rules while retaining their details.

**Retain important details** The rules of "Success Process" type should retain their details, and should not be deleted or easily refreshed by new updates. **Cannot merge two rules of type "Success Process"**
**Insertion is preferable** If a rule is updated to include the content of other rules, you should try to preserve the details of the existing content and preferably insert a categorial discussion or just insert new content to it (or its example).

When using update_rule, it's crucial to manually input the attributes directly into the function call. Avoid using existing variables to concatenate or modify rules.
For example, should not update the rule like: rule_manager.update_rule("rule_0", rule=rule_manager.all_rules["rule_0"]+rule_manager.all_rules["rule_1"])
