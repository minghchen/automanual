    "manual": "# Web Page Agent Task Manual\n\n## Overview\n\nThis manual provides guidelines for a web page agent to navigate web forums and subreddits, create and edit content, and interact with user submissions. It emphasizes efficient navigation strategies, the importance of confirming successful actions, and methods to handle errors and improve task efficiency.\n\n## Forum and Subreddit Navigation\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category includes rules for locating and interacting with specific forums and subreddits. It covers strategies for efficient navigation, such as using search functions and direct URL navigation, and what to do when a forum or subreddit cannot be found.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_0 (type=\"Success Process\"): If the task need to identify the user who made the latest post on a forum and count required comments from the user, first locate the forum, find the latest post. Next, view the profile of the user who submitted it and count required comments. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to count the comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the Showerthoughts forum:\n# [Step 1] Click link 'Forums'.\n# [Step 2] Click link 'Alphabetical' to see all forums.\n# [Step 3] Click the Showerthoughts forum\n# [Step 4] Sort the posts by newest\n# [Step 5] Click the link to the user who made the latest post\n# [Step 6] Count the comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user\n\n# If you want to find a target forum, it may not appear on the 'Forums' homepage. But you can use the link 'Alphabetical' to see all forums alphabetically.\n# After clicking the 'Forums' link\nagent.click(749) # where [749] is link 'Alphabetical'\n\n```\n\n- rule_1 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): When tasked with interacting with a specific forum or subreddit, if it is not found after scrolling and clicking 'More', consider alternative methods such as using the search function more effectively, attempting to navigate directly to the forum's URL, or exploring the search results page for clickable links or references to the forum. If these methods fail, the forum might not be accessible or listed, and the task may be impossible to complete. For example, \n```python\n# The agent attempted to find the 'movies' forum by scrolling and clicking 'More' but failed to locate it.\n# Alternative methods such as refining the search, direct URL navigation, or exploring the search results page were not explored.\n# After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the agent should consider these alternative methods.\n# The agent attempted to find the 'gadgets' forum by scrolling and navigating through pagination but failed to locate it.\n# Alternative methods such as using the search function or direct URL navigation were not explored.\n# After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the agent should consider the possibility that the forum is not accessible or listed.\n\n```\n\n- rule_2 (type=\"Success Process\"): To like all submissions by a specific user in a subreddit, use the search function to find the subreddit, navigate directly to the user's profile from the subreddit, and like each submission. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to like all submissions by CameronKelsey in the subreddit 'earthporn':\n    # [Step 1] Use the search box to search for the subreddit 'earthporn'.\n    # [Step 2] Navigate directly to the subreddit 'earthporn' by entering its URL.\n    # [Step 3] Navigate to CameronKelsey's profile.\n    # [Step 4-6] Like each visible submission by CameronKelsey.\n    # [Step 7] Confirm the success of the task with agent.stop(\"All submissions by CameronKelsey in subreddit EarthPorn have been liked\").\n    \n```\n\n- rule_3 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): When tasked with liking or interacting with submissions by a specific user in a subreddit, avoid inefficient strategies such as excessive scrolling. Instead, use the search function to find the subreddit, navigate directly to the user's profile from the subreddit, and like each submission to complete the task efficiently. Consider using search and filter features within the user's profile to directly find submissions in the specific subreddit, if available. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to like all submissions by CameronKelsey in the subreddit 'earthporn':\n# [Step 1] Use the search box to search for the subreddit 'earthporn'.\n# [Step 2] Navigate directly to the subreddit 'earthporn' by entering its URL.\n# [Step 3] Navigate to CameronKelsey's profile.\n# [Step 4-6] Like each visible submission by CameronKelsey.\n# [Step 7] Confirm the success of the task with agent.stop('All submissions by CameronKelsey in subreddit EarthPorn have been liked').\n# Note: Scrolling through the subreddit and repeatedly clicking 'More' is an inefficient strategy that can lead to exceeding the allowed number of interactions without completing the task.\n# [Efficient Strategy] Using search and filter features within the user's profile to directly find submissions in the 'news' subreddit, if available.\n```\n\n\n## Content Creation and Interaction\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category provides instructions for creating discussion posts, replying to comments, and editing posts. It emphasizes the use of specific wording, confirmation of successful actions, and efficient interaction with the web page elements.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_4 (type=\"Success Process\"): To create a discussion post in a subreddit, use the search box to find the subreddit, confirm the search results, navigate to it, click 'Submit' to create a new post, fill in the title and body with the relevant question and details, confirm the subreddit selection and the successful creation of the post, and then submit the post. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to create a discussion post about \"long distance relationship\" in the 'relationship_advice' subreddit:\n    # [Step 1] Use the search box to search for a subreddit related to \"long distance relationship\".\n    # [Step 2] Press \"Enter\" to submit the search query.\n    # [Step 3] Click on the 'relationship_advice' subreddit link to navigate to the subreddit.\n    # [Step 4] Click on the 'Submit' link to start creating a new post.\n    # [Step 5] Fill in the title and body of the post, using the exact wording from the prompt for the body.\n    # [Step 6] Click the 'Create submission' button to submit the post.\n    # [Step 7] Indicate that the task is complete with agent.stop(\"Post created\").\n    \n# For example, to create a discussion post about \"Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh\" in the 'pittsburgh' subreddit:\n# [Step 1] Use the search box to search for \"Pittsburgh\".\n# [Step 2] Click on the 'pittsburgh' subreddit link to navigate to it.\n# [Step 3] Click on the 'Submit' link to start creating a new post.\n# [Step 4] Fill in the 'Title' field with \"Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh\".\n# [Step 5] Fill in the 'Body' field with the prompt \"your opinion\".\n# [Step 6] Click the 'Create submission' button to submit the post.\n# [Step 7] Indicate that the task is complete with agent.stop(\"Post created\").\n\n# For example, to ask for product recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones within a budget of $200 in the 'headphones' subreddit:\n# [Step 1] Use the search box to search for \"noise-cancelling headphones\".\n# [Step 2] Press \"Enter\" to submit the search query.\n# [Step 3] Click on the 'headphones' subreddit link to navigate to the subreddit.\n# [Step 4] Click on the 'Submit' link to start creating a new post.\n# [Step 5] Fill in the title and body of the post, using the exact wording from the task for the body.\n# [Step 6] Click the 'Create submission' button to submit the post.\n# [Step 7] Indicate that the task is complete with agent.stop(\"Post created\").\n\n```\n\n- rule_5 (type=\"Success Process\"): To ask for product recommendations in a subreddit, use the search box to find the subreddit, confirm the search results, navigate to it, click 'Submit' to create a new post, fill in the title and body with the relevant question and details, including any budget constraints, confirm the subreddit selection and the successful creation of the post, and then submit the post. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to ask for product recommendations for used iPhone products within a budget of $1000 in the 'iphone' subreddit:\n    # [Step 1] Use the search box to search for 'used iPhone'.\n    # [Step 2] Press 'Enter' to submit the search query.\n    # [Step 3] Click on the 'iphone' subreddit link to navigate to the subreddit.\n    # [Step 4] Click on the 'Submit' link to start creating a new post.\n    # [Step 5] Fill in the title and body of the post, including the budget constraint.\n    # [Step 6] Click the 'Create submission' button to submit the post.\n    # [Step 7] Indicate that the task is complete with agent.stop('Post created').\n\n```\n\n- rule_6 (type=\"Success Process\"): To post content or complete a series of actions in a subreddit, navigate to the subreddit, click 'Submit', fill in the title and body with the relevant details, submit the post, and confirm the success of each action before proceeding to the next step. Use a specific and detailed confirmation message with `agent.stop()` that accurately reflects the task's details to confirm successful completion. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to post a notice on a virtual meetup for book reading enthusiasts:\n# [Step 1] Navigate to the subreddit (e.g., r/books).\n# [Step 2] Click 'Submit' to create a new post.\n# [Step 3] Fill in the 'Title' and 'Body' with the meetup details.\n# [Step 4] Submit the post.\n# [Step 5] Confirm the success of the post with a specific confirmation message that includes details related to the task using `agent.stop('Virtual meetup for Big Little Lies on Sep 10th posted')`.\n\n# For example, after creating a post in a subreddit:\n# [Final Step] Indicate that the task is complete with a confirmation message\n# The confirmation message should include specific details about the meetup, the subreddit name, and the title of the post.\nagent.stop('Virtual meetup for Big Little Lies on Sep 10th posted')\n\n# It's important to adhere to the exact wording of the prompt to avoid any misunderstanding or deviation from the task requirements, as mentioned in deleted_rule.\n# For example, when creating a discussion post:\n# [Step 1] Search for the subreddit using the exact wording provided and confirm the search results.\n# [Step 2] Select the subreddit and confirm the selection.\n# [Step 3] Create the post using the exact wording provided and confirm that it is successfully submitted and viewable.\n# [Step 4] Only after confirming the success of the post, issue the agent.stop('Post created') action.\n# Note: It's important to adhere to the exact wording of the prompt to avoid any misunderstanding or deviation from the task requirements.\n\n```\n\n- rule_7 (type=\"Success Process\"): To reply to a post with a specific comment, type the comment into the textbox, scroll down if necessary to reveal the 'Post' button, click the 'Post' button to submit the comment, and then confirm the success of the comment submission with a `agent.stop()` action including a confirmation message. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to reply to a post with the comment \"Yeah, pittsburgh traffic, you know...\":\n    # [Step 1] Type the comment into the textbox with the given ID\n    agent.type(661, \"Yeah, pittsburgh traffic, you know...\")\n    # [Step 2] Scroll down to reveal the 'Post' button\n    agent.scroll(\"down\")\n    # [Step 3] Click the 'Post' button to submit the comment\n    agent.click(848)\n    # [Step 4] Indicate that the task is complete with a confirmation message\n    agent.stop(\"Comment posted\")\n```\n\n- rule_8 (type=\"Success Process\"): To thumbs down the top posts ever in a forum, navigate directly to the forum's URL, sort posts by 'Top', change the time period to 'All time,' and then thumbs down the top posts. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to thumbs down the top 5 posts ever in the 'technology' forum:\n# [Step 1] Navigate directly to the 'technology' forum's URL.\n# [Step 2] Click on the 'Sort by: Hot' button to reveal sorting options.\n# [Step 3] Click on the 'Top' link to sort the posts by top votes.\n# [Step 4] Click on the 'From: Past 24 hours' button to change the time period.\n# [Step 5] Click on the 'All time' link to view the top posts ever.\n# [Step 6-10] Thumbs down the top 5 posts.\n# [Step 11] Indicate that the task is complete with a confirmation message.\n\n```\n\n- rule_9 (type=\"Success Process\"): To edit a post by adding a specific line to the body, locate the post first. If the post cannot be found by scrolling, consider using a search function or direct navigation. Repeated scrolling without locating the post is inefficient and may lead to task failure. For example, \n```python\n# Scroll down to reveal more content\nagent.scroll(\"down\")\n# Click the 'Edit' link for the Nvidia RTX 4090 post\nagent.click(1537)\n# Type the additional line into the textbox for the body of the post without clearing existing content\nagent.type(1911, \"\n\nEDIT: This news aged well\", clear_existing=False)\n# Click the 'Edit submission' button to submit the changes\nagent.click(1991)\n# Confirm the task completion\nagent.stop(\"The post has been edited successfully.\")\n```\n\n\n## Error Handling and Efficiency\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category addresses common errors and inefficiencies encountered by the agent. It provides corrective measures and alternative strategies to avoid task failure, such as avoiding repetitive scrolling and considering alternative navigation methods.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_10 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): When navigation to a specific subreddit results in errors such as HTTP ERROR 502 or a 404 Not Found error, it suggests that the subreddit cannot be accessed within the environment, and the task may be impossible to complete. For example, \n```python\n# After multiple attempts to search for the 'sports' subreddit and direct URL navigation:\n# [Attempt 1] Use the search function to find the subreddit.\n# [Attempt 2] Navigate directly to the subreddit URL.\n# Both attempts result in HTTP ERROR 502 or a 404 Not Found error, indicating an environmental issue.\nagent.stop('N/A')  # Indicate that the task cannot be completed due to environmental constraints.\n\n```\n\n- rule_11 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): If the post cannot be located by scrolling, promptly switch to alternative methods such as using a search function or direct navigation. Avoid repetitive scrolling actions that do not lead to locating the post. For example, In epoch_52, the agent repeatedly scrolled up and down but failed to locate the post titled 'Star Trek Starfleet Academy series', leading to task failure.\n\n- rule_12 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): Repeatedly scrolling up and down without locating the specific post can lead to task failure. If the post is not found within the visible area after multiple attempts, consider using alternative methods such as search functions or direct navigation. For example, \n```python\n# The agent repeatedly scrolled up and down to find the post titled \"Ted Lasso\" but was unsuccessful.\n# After multiple attempts, the agent should have considered using a search function or direct navigation.\n# Example of an inefficient scrolling strategy:\nfor _ in range(10):  # Arbitrary number of attempts\n    agent.scroll(\"down\")\n    agent.scroll(\"up\")\n# The agent should have considered alternative methods after a few unsuccessful attempts.\n\n```\n\n- rule_13 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): If the post cannot be located by scrolling and clicking 'More', and no search function or direct navigation options are available, the task may be impossible to complete. For example, \n```python\n\n    # The agent attempted to locate the post titled \"Lord of the Rings\" by scrolling and clicking 'More'\n    # After multiple attempts, the post was not found, and no search function or direct navigation options were observed\n    # The agent concluded that the task could not be completed\n    agent.scroll(\"down\")\n    agent.click(1113)  # Click 'More'\n    agent.scroll(\"up\")\n    agent.stop(\"N/A\")  # Indicate task failure\n    \n```\n"
