    "manual": "# Web Page Agent Operation Manual\n\n## Overview\n\nThis manual provides a set of rules for a web page agent to navigate and interact within forum-based web environments. It includes guidelines for performing tasks such as identifying and interacting with posts, creating content, and managing errors. The rules are categorized based on their use cases, from basic navigation to complex content management and error resolution.\n\n## Forum Navigation and Interaction\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category includes rules for navigating forum sections, sorting posts, identifying specific content, and interacting with forum elements like user profiles and comments.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_0 (type=\"Success Process\"): To identify the user who made the latest post on a forum and count required comments from the user, the steps are: 1. Click the 'Forums' link to navigate to the forums section. 2. Click the 'Alphabetical' link to search for the forum alphabetically if it's not visible on the 'Forums' homepage. 3. Click on the forum link to enter it. 4. Click the 'Sort by: Hot' button to open the sorting options, then click 'New' to sort posts by the newest. 5. Click on the user who made the latest post to view their profile. 6. If there are no comments to evaluate, issue the stop action with the answer '0'. For example, Refer to the success code in 'epoch_4_conclusion'.\n\n- rule_1 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): When navigating a list of items such as forum posts, ensure to use the unique IDs associated with each item's link to avoid repeated navigation to the same item. Manually inspect the observation to identify counts or links. If expected elements or pagination links are not found, or IDs have changed, take alternative actions such as using the subreddit's search functionality or other targeted search strategies. Keep track of which items have been processed to prevent looping over the same action. For example, \n```python\n# Correct approach for counting elements and handling missing pagination:\n# Manually inspect the observation and count the elements as needed.\n# If 'Next' link is not found or ID has changed, scroll down to reveal more forums.\nagent.scroll(direction='down')\n\n# Use unique IDs for each post's heading link and keep track of inspected posts.\n# Example:\nagent.click(unique_id_for_post)  # Replace with the actual unique ID for each post\n\n```\n\n- rule_2 (type=\"Unresolved Error\"): When identifying posts that recommend a single book, ensure that the post contains a personal recommendation or review of the book, not just a mention of its availability or general discussion about the book. Additionally, do not rely solely on the presence of the word 'book' and quotation marks in the title. Instead, look for clear indications of a single book title. Also, do not assume the absence of a visible downvote count means there are zero downvotes. Click on the 'Comments' link to view the full list of comments, including the exact counts of upvotes and downvotes for each comment. For example, \n```python\n# Correct approach for identifying a single book recommendation:\nif '\"' in title:\n    # Extract the book name only if the format suggests a single book title\n    start = title.find('\"') + 1\n    end = title.find('\"', start)\n    book_name = title[start:end]\n    if book_name and is_valid_book_title(book_name):  # Implement is_valid_book_title to check for valid book title format\n        # Continue analyzing posts to find a clear personal recommendation or review.\n        # If a post contains a user's personal recommendation or review of the book:\n        # agent.stop(book_name)\n        # If no such posts are found:\n        # agent.stop('N/A')\n# Incorrect assumption leading to failure:\n# Assuming no visible downvote count means 0 downvotes.\nagent.click(comments_link_id)  # Replace with the actual ID of the 'Comments' link\n# Then count the comments with more downvotes than upvotes.\n\n```\n\n- rule_3 (type=\"Success Process\"): To find a post about supporting local bookstores in the 'books' forum and identify the organization involved, follow these steps: 1. Click the 'Forums' link to navigate to the forums section. 2. Click the 'Alphabetical' link if the forum is not visible on the homepage. 3. Click on the 'books' forum link. 4. Inspect the top posts for mentions of supporting local bookstores. 5. Click on the relevant post to read its content. 6. Issue the stop action with the name of the organization involved if the post confirms support for local bookstores. For example, \n```python\n# Example of finding a post about supporting local bookstores:\n# [Step 1] Click the 'Forums' link.\n# [Step 2] Click the 'Alphabetical' link.\n# [Step 3] Click on the 'books' forum link.\n# [Step 4] Inspect the top posts for mentions of supporting local bookstores.\n# [Step 5] Click on the relevant post to read its content.\n# [Step 6] Issue the stop action with the name of the organization involved.\n\n```\n\n- rule_4 (type=\"Success Process\"): To upvote the newest post in a subreddit, navigate to the forums section, use the 'Alphabetical' link if needed, enter the subreddit, sort posts by 'New', click the upvote button on the newest post, and issue the stop action. Specific IDs observed in epoch_13: Forums link ID: 66, Alphabetical link ID: 749, Subreddit link ID: 1468, Sort by: Hot button ID: 1827, New link ID: 3564, Upvote button ID: 3839. For example, \n```python\n# Example of upvoting the newest post in the 'Futurology' subreddit, assumed to be 'future technology':\n# [Step 1] Click the 'Forums' link (ID: 66).\n# [Step 2] Click the 'Alphabetical' link (ID: 749).\n# [Step 3] Click on the 'Futurology' forum link (ID: 1474).\n# [Step 4] Click the 'Sort by: Hot' button (ID: 1835).\n# [Step 5] Click 'New' to sort posts by the newest (ID: 3587).\n# [Step 6] Click the upvote button for the newest post (ID: 3877).\n# [Step 7] Issue the stop action.\n\n```\n\n- rule_5 (type=\"Success Process\"): To reply to a comment on a forum post, the agent may need to click the 'Reply' link, and if no textbox appears, use the 'Permalink' link to navigate to a focused view of the comment. Then, click the 'Reply' link again to trigger the reply textbox, type the message, and click 'Post' to submit the reply. If there is no confirmation of the reply being posted after multiple attempts, consider clicking the 'Permalink' link of the comment to reply correctly.
