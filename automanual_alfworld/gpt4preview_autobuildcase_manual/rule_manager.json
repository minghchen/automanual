    "manual": "# Housekeeper Agent Manual\n\n## Overview\n\nThis manual provides a set of rules for a housekeeper agent to navigate and perform tasks within a simulated environment. The rules cover object search and retrieval, object interaction and task completion, environment and state awareness, and efficiency and error avoidance.\n\n## Object Search and Retrieval\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category includes rules for locating objects within the environment. It emphasizes the need to check all possible locations and update the search strategy based on the environment's changing state.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_0 (type=\"Special Mechanism\"): The agent must go to a receptacle or surface to observe its contents, even if it is open. This includes all possible locations where an object could be found.\n\n- rule_1 (type=\"Useful Helper Method\"): When searching for multiple instances of an object, repeat the 'find_object' method for each instance to account for changes in the environment. For example, \n```python\n# Define helper method to find the object that is needed\ndef find_object(agent, recep_to_check, object_name):\n    for receptacle in recep_to_check:\n        observation = agent.go_to(receptacle)\n        # Check if we need to open the receptacle. If we do, open it.\n        if 'closed' in observation:\n            observation = agent.open(receptacle)\n        # Check if the object is in/on the receptacle.\n        if object_name in observation:\n            object_ids = get_object_with_id(observation, object_name)\n            return object_ids, receptacle\n    return None, None\n\n```\n\n\n## Object Interaction and Task Completion\n\n### Introduction\n\nThese rules guide the agent on how to interact with objects to complete tasks, such as heating, cooling, and examining objects with the aid of another object.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_2 (type=\"Success Process\"): If the task is to place a cooled or heated object, repeat the search process for the object using 'find_object' method in rule_1, take the object, cool/heat it as required, and place it in the target location (receptacle, appliance, etc.). Ensure the agent's location and the state of the environment are updated after each action. Additionally, check the state of the target receptacle to ensure it can hold the object. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to cool a mug and place it on a shelf:\n# [Step 1] Use 'find_object' method to search for the mug\n# [Step 2] Take the mug\n# [Step 3] Cool the mug with the fridge\n# [Step 4] Place the mug on the shelf\n# Assertions should be included after each action as shown in the example code.\n```\n\n- rule_3 (type=\"Success Process\"): When the task is to examine an object with the aid of another object, locate both objects and bring them together to complete the task. For example, \n```python\n# [Step 1] Locate the first object (e.g., book)\n# [Step 2] Locate the second object (e.g., desklamp)\n# [Step 3] Bring the first object to the location of the second object\n# [Step 4] Ensure that the second object is in a state that can aid in examining the first object (e.g., desklamp is turned on)\n```\n\n- rule_4 (type=\"Special Phenomena/Mechanism\"): Examination of an object with the aid of another object may not require an explicit 'use' action; proximity to the aiding object can be sufficient. However, if the task specifies an action such as 'look at' under a light source, an explicit 'use' action to turn on the light may be necessary, as observed in epoch_14. For example, \n```python\n# In epoch_3, the agent completed the task of examining the book with the desklamp by simply bringing the book to the desklamp's location without an explicit 'examine' action.\n```\n\n- rule_5 (type=\"Success Process\"): When the task is to place multiple instances of the same object in a receptacle, search all receptacles for each object using the 'find_object' method in rule_1, take each object, and then place them in the target receptacle. Track objects that have been found and placed to avoid duplication. Ensure the agent's location and the state of the environment are updated after each action. For example, \n```python\n# For example, to place two CDs in a sidetable:\n# [Step 1] Use 'find_object' method to search for the first CD\n# [Step 2] Take the first CD\n# [Step 3] Place the first CD in the sidetable\n# [Step 4] Use 'find_object' method to search for the second CD\n# [Step 5] Take the second CD\n# [Step 6] Place the second CD in the sidetable\n# Assertions should be included after each action as shown in the example code.\n```\n\n\n## Environment and State Awareness\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe agent must be aware of the environment's state, including movement restrictions and the usability of receptacles based on their state.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_6 (type=\"Special Phenomena/Mechanism\"): The agent may encounter situations where 'Nothing happens' when attempting to move directly between certain receptacles. This suggests there may be restrictions on movement that need to be considered when planning actions. For example, In epoch_12, the agent attempted to go from 'cabinet_8' to 'cabinet_7' and from 'cabinet_4' to 'cabinet_3' and observed that 'Nothing happens', indicating a possible movement restriction.\n\n- rule_7 (type=\"Special Phenomena/Mechanism\"): When using a microwave, the agent can interact with it (e.g., heat an object) even if there is another object inside, the agent is holding something, and the microwave door is not explicitly mentioned to be open. For example, In epoch_1, the agent was able to heat the mug with the microwave even though there was an egg inside the microwave and the agent was holding the mug.\n\n- rule_8 (type=\"Special Phenomena/Mechanism\"): The usability of receptacles for certain tasks may be affected by their state (e.g., full, empty). This should be considered when planning actions. For example, In epoch_9, the agent assumed that 'sinkbasin_1' was not full and could be used to clean the soapbar. This assumption suggests that the state of the receptacle is important for its usability.\ng., full, empty) when planning actions.\n\n## Efficiency and Error Avoidance\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis category focuses on rules that help the agent avoid redundant actions and complete tasks efficiently.\n\n#### Included Rules\n\n- rule_9 (type=\"Corrected Error\"): The agent should not interact with an object that has already been used to complete part of the task. This avoids duplication of actions and ensures the task is completed efficiently. For example, In epoch_15, the agent attempted to take the same pencil (pencil_3) twice from the coffeetable, which was incorrect. The agent should have tracked that pencil_3 was already placed and searched for a different pencil.\n\n"
