You are observing a housekeeper agent as it codes and acts within a simulated environment (game). Your role is to construct a manual of rules to not only assist the agent in completing tasks but also to do so with the least amount of code attempts/errors. This requires recording and analyzing the experiences of the agent's successes and failures, and updating previous discoveries.

[user]
You will be presented with the current epoch's trajectory. The interaction in the trajectory includes the agent's analysis, execution code, and the resulting feedback.

You should use the following methods of rule_manager to build and improve rules.

rule_manager.write_rule(rule, type="", example="", validation_record="")
# Write down a new rule of the game you discovered.
# Parameters:
# - rule: a rule of the game you discovered.
# - type: the type of the rule, chosen from ["Special Phenomena/Mechanism", "Corrected Error", "Unresolved Error", "Useful Helper Method", "Success Process"]. The "Corrected Error" can include misunderstandings and mistakes that have been corrected.
# - example: an example (or code) from the trajectory demonstrates this rule. You can add detailed information in the comment.
# - validation_record: your validation record on this rule, including the epoch IDs and rule IDs from which this rule is induced.

rule_manager.update_rule(rule_id, rule="", type="", example="", validation_record=""),
# Rewrite the attributes of an existing rule when you come up with a better understanding.
# Input only the attributes you want to rewrite.

rule_manager.stop_generating()
# Description: stop generating rules from the current epoch.
# Use Case: When you believe that the trajectory of the current epoch is not needed or insufficient to derive any more new rules, you can call this function and wait for the next epoch's data. You should also call this function when you have updated all rules for the current epoch.

At each epoch, an agent is created in an environment, and the initial observation and target task are printed.
The agent can only use the following action functions. If the precondition of the action is not met, its observation will include "Nothing happens":

agent.go_to(receptacle) # Go to a receptacle and update the agent's location.
agent.open(receptacle) # Open a receptacle and observe its contents.
agent.close(receptacle) # Close a opened receptacle.
agent.take_from(object, receptacle) # Take an object from a receptacle if the agent is not holding anything.
agent.put_in_or_on(object, receptacle) # Put an object in or on a receptacle if the agent is holding it.
agent.use(object) # Use a lamp.
agent.clean_with(object, receptacle) # Clean an object with a receptacle.
agent.heat_with(object, receptacle) # Heat an object with a receptacle.
agent.cool_with(object, receptacle) # Cool an object with a receptacle.
get_object_with_id(observation, object_name) # Extracts a list of object_ids with the specified object_name from the observation.
# If the agent has not completed the task after 50 action steps in an environment, the task fails.

Upon receiving the current trajectory, you should first identify the case of the current trajectory's result and then build rules following the corresponding instructions.
