This reason is often your mistake or misunderstanding rather than the environment's error. By carefully comparing with applicable rules and examples, pinpoint where your code deviated from expected standards. If there exist coding errors, specify the segments of the problematic code and elucidate how they contributed to the errors. If you want to write a correction for an error, you must double-check its plausibility! Additionally, determine whether your codes were in strict adherence to the relevant rules and examples.

If you encountered a coding error, please copy the portion of the code that led to the major error, along with the feedback from the environment.

Please analyze the scenario to identify the root cause of the observed mistakes, and describe the existing rules related to the mistakes. Then check whether there exists a 'Success Process' rule applicable to this type of task. Finally, determine whether the fault stems from:
- *Imperfect Rules*: the agent encounters unexpected phenomena that are not fully documented in the current rules, or the rules have not included the 'Success Process' of this task type.
- *Imperfect Agent*: the rules fully document the 'Success Process' and error reminders of such scenarios, but the agent fails to follow these rules meticulously.
Consider each step of the process carefully and conclude with either *Imperfect Rules* or *Imperfect Agent* based on your analysis.

failure_case_classify_prompt = '''
Please begin by methodically evaluating the process: identify which steps were successfully executed by the agent and at which point the final error that led to failure occurred (You do not need to determine the root cause of the failure). Also, describe the existing rules related to each step. Then check whether there exists a 'Success Process' rule applicable to this type of task.

Finally, determine whether the fault lies in:
- *Imperfect Rules*: The agent encounters not anticipated phenomena or fully documented in the current rules, or the rules have not included the 'Success Process' of this task type.
- *Imperfect Agent*: Despite the rules providing a complete documentation of the 'Success Process' and error reminders of such scenarios, the agent fails to follow these rules meticulously.
Conclude your analysis by categorizing either *Imperfect Rules* or *Imperfect Agent*.

[Output Format Instructions]
Based on the current trajectory and your analysis, you should output the following things:
* Potential Rules: Describe your thoughts about potential rules based on the current trajectory. Depending on the results, you may need to check *Success Process*, *Helper Method*, *Corrected Error*, *Unresolved Error*, and other findings in sequence. Each potential rule needs to be clarified whether it is related to existing rules.
* Check Difference: Describe whether the potential rules target different phenomena.
* Check Existing Rules: Describe whether existing rules are conflicted or need updating. 
* Code: Finally, sequentially call the rule_manager's functions within '```python' and '```'.

[Detailed instructions]
**Maintain a maximum of 12 rules** Try to make each rule useful and non-repetitive, and insert new rules into closely related ones.
**Add Rules** Extract "Special Phenomena/Mechanism" rules when interactions appear counterintuitive, environment-specific, or when the agent expresses uncertainty about the environment mechanics (e.g., using "assume..." in the comment). Refrain from making speculative suggestions or guesses. Instead, conservatively document phenomena and the agent's valuable insights.
**Keep new rules targeted and precise.** Break down a large phenomenon or general strategy into targeted units as individual rules. These can later be upgraded or merged into a more general or larger rule.
**Write rules' scope** The time when the rule is triggered, or the task scope of the rule should be mentioned at the beginning of the rule.
**Avoiding overconfidence for new rules** Please acknowledge the need for further verification in your note.

**Update Rules** If an existing rule needs to be updated to include a new phenomenon, you should try to preserve the details of the existing content and preferably insert a categorial discussion or just insert new content into it (or its example). Especially, the rules of "Success Process" and "Useful Helper Method" type should retain their details. Then update the rule's validation_record after further verification or revision.

**Rules for Success** You should extract "Useful Helper Method" and "Success Process":
* For each useful helper function identified: If it is not already included in a rule, create a rule of type "Useful Helper Method" and record its code unchanged in the rule's example section. If a method with similar functionality already exists in the rule, consider whether the rule needs to be updated.
* If the success process does not fall within the scope of an existing "Success Process" rule, faithfully document all steps (marked as "[Step]") in the successful code within a rule of type "Success Process", and document necessary codes and reminders in the rule's example; if the success process of the current task falls within the scope of the existing "Success Process" rule, consider whether the rule needs to be updated to incorporate the current roadmap.

**Rules for Misstep** You should reflect on the main misstep to improve efficiency and log it into the "Corrected Error" type rule, including corrective code validated by the feedback (with the help of the agent's analysis and code, but its conclusion may not be correct and should be checked carefully).

**Rules for Misstep** Identify existing rules that agents failed to follow and resulted in major mistakes. You should update the rule to emphasize some important points (you can add **...** at the part of the rule you want to emphasize) or to add error-prone points (perhaps added to the comments of the example code).

**Rules for Final Error** Based on your previous analysis and conclusion, summarize the final error that led to failure. You should write an "Unresolved Error" rule to record the error: in what situation, what the agent did, and what results were produced. So that they can serve as reminders for the agent in the future. Please don't rush to propose any definitive reasons or suggestions for the error; just record it.

The final error is unresolved and cannot be included in rules of other types than "Unresolved Error".
As the task failed, you cannot write down any "Success Process" or "Useful Helper Method" rules.
